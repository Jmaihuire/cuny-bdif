## Description ##

This repository includes basic information for class sessions on analyzing big data in Finance and on Assignment C. First, we will cover how to use a Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel programing in C/C++, as well as how to access and use the high performance computing cluster at Baruch. Next, we learn about Hadoop and Apache Spark to analyze data at a massive scale and streaming data, and then apply them to see if Twitter data can be used to predict stock returns (Assignment C).
